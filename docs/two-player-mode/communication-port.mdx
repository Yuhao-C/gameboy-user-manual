# Using Communication Port

At the top of the Game Boy Color, there is a communication port that uses infrared rays. This communication port is used to exchange information between two Game Boy color devices that use Game Boy Paks with the infrared communication port.

:::info
Two devices must be kept between 1.5” and 2” (4-5cm) apart for the communication feature to work properly.
:::

The little triangle marks that are above the displays must be aligned and pointed toward each other. The connection using the infrared communication port will be more stable if both devices are placed on a flat surface.

**Please note the following when using the Communication Port:**

- A maximum of 2 Game Boy Devices can connect at one time.
- Avoid direct sunlight as the bright light may disrupt the connection using infrared rays.
- Keep the lens over the communication port clean and free from scratches.
- Do not block the communication port such as using stickers or tapes.
- Remove any objects between two communication ports.
- Avoid using this feature around other infrared devices. They may interfere with each other.
- If the batteries are low on power, the communication feature may not work as intended. Replace the batteries if the Power Indicator becomes dim.
